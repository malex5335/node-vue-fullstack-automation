# node-vue-fullstack-automation

This repos is a demo for my [blogpost](https://q-bit.me/quick-dirty-how-to-deploy-a-fullstack-vue-js-app-with-a-working-node-js-backend) on https://q-bit.me/. 

If you came here for a quickstart, try

```sh
# Pull down the demo repos
$ git clone https://github.com/tq-bit/node-vue-fullstack-automation.git

# Step in and start the build process
$ cd node-vue-fullstack-automation && npm run build-app
```

You'll then have an application running on your http://localhost:3000 which you can use as a boilerplate for further development and automated deployment.
